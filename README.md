# 0. Basic/Introduction
- [CS50](https://cs50.harvard.edu/college/2020/fall/#:~:text=Introduction%20to%20the%20intellectual%20enterprises%20of%20computer%20science%20and%20the%20art%20of%20programming.): Introduction to the intellectual enterprises of computer science and the art of programming. 
- [CS106B Programming Abstractions](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs106b/): this is a basic/introductory course from Stanford whose content includes knowledge of object-oriented programming, data structures (collections, graphs, etc.).
- [Computer Organization & Systems](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs107/): CS107 is the third course in Stanford's introductory programming sequence. The CS106 courses provide you with a solid foundation in programming methodology and abstractions, and CS107 follows on this to build up and expand your breadth and depth of programming experience and techniques. The course will work from the C programming language down to the microprocessor to de-mystify the machine.

# 1. Mathematical Background
## 1.1 Calculus
- [Thomas Calculus](https://www.academia.edu/38787152/Pdf_Thomas_Calculus_Multivariable_14th_Edition): Thomas' Calculus helps students reach the level of mathematical proficiency and maturity you require, but with support for students who need it through its balance of clear and intuitive explanations, current applications, and generalized concepts. In the 14th Edition, new co-author Christopher Heil (Georgia Institute of Technology) partners with author Joel Hass to preserve what is best about Thomas' time-tested text while reconsidering every word and every piece of art with today's students in mind. The result is a text that goes beyond memorizing formulas and routine procedures to help students generalize key concepts and develop deeper understanding. This course ([Course Link](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDMsr9K-rj53DwVRMYO3t5Yr)) could definitely help you intuitively get a better understanding of Calculus and it is really the best course I have ever taken.
## 1.2 Linear Algebra
- [MIT Linear Algebra](https://github.com/yizhen20133868/MIT-Linear-Algebra-Notes): This course parallels the combination of theory and applications in Professor Strang’s textbook Introduction to Linear Algebra. The course picks out four key applications in the book: Graphs and Networks; Systems of Differential Equations; Least Squares and Projections; and Fourier Series and the Fast Fourier Transform. This course ([Course Link](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab)) could definitely help you intuitively get a better understanding of Calculus and it is really the best course I have ever taken. Moreover, this interactive book ([Book](https://textbooks.math.gatech.edu/ila/)) could help you learn Linear Algebra more interestingly.
## 1.3 Probabilistic
- [MIT RES.6-012](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1uW3qMFA9Ho&list=PLUl4u3cNGP60hI9ATjSFgLZpbNJ7myAg6): Probability is the science of how likely events are to happen. At its simplest, it’s concerned with the roll of a dice, or the fall of the cards in a game. But probability is also vital to science and life more generally. I really recommend this course from MIT, and this book ([Book](http://tomlr.free.fr/Math%E9matiques/Math%20Complete/Probability%20and%20statistics/CRC%20-%20standard%20probability%20and%20Statistics%20tables%20and%20formulae%20-%20DANIEL%20ZWILLINGER.pdf)) is the most comprehensive dictionary of probability and statistics I have ever seen.

Besides, as the course is too long, people have to spend a lot of time following it, there are some lecture notes which could help you have an overview of probalistic quickly.
- [Probability Theory: STAT310/MATH230](https://statweb.stanford.edu/~adembo/stat-310b/lnotes.pdf)
- [Probability for first year mathematicians at Cambridge in winter 2015](http://www.statslab.cam.ac.uk/~rrw1/prob/index.html)

## 1.4 Statistic
This course from MIT, named [Statistics for Applications (video)](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-650-statistics-for-applications-fall-2016/index.htm). This course offers an in-depth the theoretical foundations for statistical methods that are useful in many applications. The goal is to understand the role of mathematics in the research and development of efficient statistical methods. And for people who prefer slides, this [Site](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-650-statistics-for-applications-fall-2016/) may could help you.

# 2. Core Course in Computer Science
